# THEME IS "CONNECTED WORLDS"
## Uncover the ancient symbols, knowledge is one that matters.

Not done entirely in 0h*.
I created the barebone project files before the 2AM, then went to sleep, and wake up at 2:40AM :(
I missed the mark for 3->2AM, and then left for an hour more.

Try the game at http://gamejolt.com/games/connected-worlds/103854 (web player, x86, android).

Also, there are builds for x86 and android here , just click on Releases on top.
